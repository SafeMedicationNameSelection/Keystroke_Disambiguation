# Keystroke Disambiguation

## What is keystroke disambiguation for drug product and medication names?

Keystroke disambiguation is the process of typing one character at a time as a method of searching over a namespace to find and select a single drug product or medication name. As each new character is entered the search is focused towards a smaller and smaller group of possible candidate names until finally enough characters are typed in to arrive at only one name. This process simply removes drug product and medication ambiguity keystroke by keystroke.

Unfortunately, many medication errors, including some that have led to harm and death, have involved inadequate keystroke disambiguation.

To minimize the risk of more of this type of medication error, since 2019 the Institute for Safe Medication Practices has recommended the entry of a minimum of the first five characters of a drug name (unless the name has fewer than five letters) during keystroke searches.

## Problems Keeping Drug Product and Medication Names Straight

For approved drug products, our drug product and medication namespace is a crowded, confusing, constantly changing mashup. Here is a quick tour through some of the many issues that pertain to keeping the names straight and selecting the correct drug product. 

The first issue is that we call the same medication by multiple names. Approved drug products contain medications with generic names, however the drug products themselves can have one or more brand names in the marketplace (e.g., aspirin versus Ecotrin and Zorprin). 

The second issue is that drug products are often referred to in a shorthand way by using only the generic names of the medications they carry (e.g., “May I have an aspirin?”). The drug product in this case might be an ‘aspirin 81 mg oral tablet’ or an ‘aspirin 325 mg oral tablet’ or something else. Using generic names this way can cause confusion and may lead to errors. 

The third issue is that multiple medications can be found inside single drug products. These “combination” drug-products are very common and often used. Examples include Vicodin, which contains the generic medications acetaminophen and hydrocodone, and Hyzaar, which contains hydrochlorothiazide and losartan. 

A fourth issue is like the second. Brand name drug products, whether they are combinations or not, are often referred to in a shorthand way (e.g., “I use Advair to control my asthma.”). Advair is the brand name for a delivery device with an inhalable powder containing salmeterol and fluticasone. 

At this point in our tour, we have only covered four issues but perhaps you are beginning to see why people have problems keeping drug product and medication names straight. There are many more issues.

A fifth issue is that many drug product or generic medication names look-alike. Examples include Actos and Actonel, chlorpromazine and chlorpropamide, prednisone and prednisolone. These and other examples appear on lists of confused names.

A sixth issue is that even drug product or generic medication names that do not look alike sometimes still sound alike. Similar sounding names can cause confusion in conversation. Examples of this issue are cetirizine and sertraline, Lodine and iodine, Os-Cal and Asacol.  

A seventh issue has to do with “salt forms.” Chemically speaking, active ingredients are sometimes produced using different counterions. When this happens, the generic medication is given two or more similar names, the only difference being the counterion. For example, metoprolol tartrate has a different salt form than metoprolol succinate. Metoprolol tartrate is only used in immediate release oral drug products whereas metoprolol succinate is instead used in sustained release products. A good example of many salt forms comes from calcium, which is provided as an acetate, carbonate, chloride, gluceptate, gluconate, metrizoate, or oxybate.
